# run python from an operating system command prmpt
# type the following:

msg = "Hello World"
print(msg)

# write it into a file called hello.py
# open a command prompt and type "python hello.py"
# this should run the script and print "Hello World"

# vscode alternative; Run the following in a terminal
# by selecting the two lines and pressing Shift+Enter

# vscode alternative 2; you can right click and select
# "Run selection/line in Python terminal" from the context menu

# You'll notice that the terminal window is still open, you can also type
# code there that will be immediately interpreted (i.e. try a different message)

# N.B. the underscore (this only makes sense on an interpreter command line)
# an underscore represents the result of the last unassigned statement on the
# command line:
# 3 + 5
# print(_) <-- will be 8
